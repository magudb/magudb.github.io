#Why"
DevOps is not born out of the academic community but from the modern developer's community and the unicorns of the internet age (Netflix, Google etc...). This is why I think it is interesting to look at through another optic which I'm not used to, I have a clear understanding of DevOps which I need to be challenged.

I will examine:
* How do we define DevOps?
* Why do we implement DevOps?
* How do we implement DevOps?

There are two sides to these questions - What does the literature say and how is it defined in "real" life.
