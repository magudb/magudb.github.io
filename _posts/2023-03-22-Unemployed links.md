## Hi all,

_I'm seeking new IT opportunities after saying goodbye to my role as VP of Engineering at CBIT + Klikbook. With an Executive Master's in IT Management and a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Social Science, I bring a unique perspective to both technical and human aspects of the industry. My experience includes building and leading skilled engineering teams to drive growth and success.

If you're aware of any opportunities aligning with my background, please reach out. I'm happy to answer any questions or discuss potential roles._

Best,
Magnus
