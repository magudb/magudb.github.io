*Hi all,*

*I'm seeking new IT opportunities after saying goodbye to my role as VP of Engineering at CBIT + Klikbook. With an Executive Master's in IT Management and a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Social Science, I bring a unique perspective to both technical and human aspects of the industry. My experience includes building and leading skilled engineering teams to drive growth and success.*

*If you're aware of any opportunities aligning with my background, please reach out. I'm happy to answer any questions or discuss potential roles.*

*Best, Magnus*
