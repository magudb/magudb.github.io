##  My favorits (*)
  * [DDD: THE GOD THAT FAILED?](http://engineering.laterooms.com/ddd-the-god-that-failed/) - The applicability of DDD which is so often missed: complicated domains. Some software doesn't even have a domain, let alone a complicated one. Therefore, DDD is not universally applicable. i think that i the smell i could smell but couldn't formulate.

  * [Why Ford's CIO is shifting gears to bimodal IT](http://www.cio.com/article/3015360/it-strategy/why-fords-cio-is-shifting-gears-to-bimodal-it.html) - I think Bi-modal/ambidexterity is important, IT and the businessshould be one. IT is not a service it is a product and strategy.
