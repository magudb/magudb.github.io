it`'unsafeeval'`Allows unsafe dynamic code evaluation such as eval If you need this enabled you can use 'unsafeeval' but again this is not recommended as it is easy for untrusted code to sneak into eval blocksCSP level 1 is supported in all major browsers and in IE 1011 with the XContentSecurityPolicy header and CSP Level 2 is less supported see browser support for Content Security Policy Level 1 and Content Security Policy Level 2For more on security see this Both Sides Of The Attack  Troy Hunt  Niall Merrigan  Security Day 2016 and Web Security Essentials By Exle  Troy Hunt  Security Day 2016Implementing NWebSec and Content Security PolicyFor the purpose of this I wil be using Sitecore 81 rev 151207 stripped of all the Sitecore fat This is not a requirement but for my vanity1The SetupThis is easy to implement but i will only recommend using it on CDs only Since you will have to expose more attack vectors to make Sitecore CM and CD work with CSP  Create a Sitecore solution your favorite way in my exle i create an empty web application and dump Sitecore into that  PMgt InstallPackage NWebsecand now we are protected we just need to configure it for our needsThis is a basic configuration where we have enabled CSP in order to ensure that we can run the correct scripts font and images we need to add sources                                                               I will go through the options which we actually do something all other will be ¬¥self¬¥ by the ¬¥defaultsrc¬¥DefaultsrcSet to self only we will handle the specific overrides in the childrenScriptsrcHer we will also set self but with 3 sources             These are the javascript sources I use in my fancy demo websiteImgsrcThis is a little more exciting since we have Base64 images we need to add ¬¥data¬¥ and we need          FontsrcWe are using fontawesome which is hosted on Cloudflare so we need to ensure we can load the font from there    Reporting CSP violationsif you add this to you configuration NWebSEc will use the builtin reporting i have implemented a simple reporter to Sitecore logpublic class Global  SitecoreWebApplication{    protected void NWebSecHttpHeaderSecurityModule_CspViolationReportedobject sender CspViolationReportEventArgs e    {        var report  eViolationReport        string msg             $CSP  Blocked  {reportDetailsBlockedUri} which violated  {reportDetailsViolatedDirective} and Referrer  {reportDetailsReferrer}        SitecoreDiagnosticsLogWarnmsg sender    }}XframeoptionsThe XFrameOptions HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a  ltiframegt or You should also do security on your iframes for my solution I have used the option ¬¥SameOrigin¬¥To read more see The Xframeoptions Response Header                                          HTTP Strict Transport SecurityJust enable it to to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking and you can force the browser to hardcode this enforcing here But Troy Huns has alot more on the topic here Understanding Http Strict Transport Security Hsts And Preloading It Into The BrowserTo enable it on your site add                                           TLSSSL EverythingFor you and your users you should use TLSSSL the ensure transport security If you find certificates to expensive you can use Lets Encrypt you can implement it in IIS Using Lets Encrypt With Iis On Windows You could use a proxyload balancer to do TLSSSL termination this would also lessen the load on your frontend server but i will require strict security behind the proxyTo learn more about TLSSSL termination see How To Set Up Nginx Load Balancing With Ssl TerminationWrapping upAll this is of course not that simple as i put it here but i think you should use it and if you have to many sources you in you code this will blow up But i think this will help you also with governace of your frontend dependencies so you dont end up with thirdparty jquery frenzy I have add all my code to here  Nwebsecdemo 1 CMS as a platform or Sitecore is a monolith bulks down development and time to market most often ends up as a big ball of mud"
