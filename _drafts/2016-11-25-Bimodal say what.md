#Introduction#
Gartner and Forrester both introducede the idea of a dual mode IT, my interpertation of this is a reintroduction of ambidexterity[^1] set only in the context of IT. I have not read the complete setup from Gartner, but i read the [Executive summary](https://www.gartner.com/imagesrv/cio/pdf/cio_agenda_execsum2014.pdf) and this [What Gartner’s Bimodal It Model Means To Enterprise Cios | Cio](http://www.cio.com/article/2875803/cio-role/what-gartner-s-bimodal-it-model-means-to-enterprise-cios.html){:target="_blank"}.
Based on this interpretation i will look at some of the critique and ideas of this reintroduction of ambidexterity.

I think we need something like bimodal, though i think Gartners Bimodal is the wrong way, we have had the idea of the dual nature of organization for a while now.
> In his seminal work on Exploration and Exploitation in organizational learning, March (1991) acknowledged the fundamental distinction between two gestalts of organizational behavior. Whereas Exploration engages individuals and organizations in search, experimentation, and variation, Exploitation enhances productivity and efficiency through choice, execution, and variance reduction. [^Lavie, et al., 2010]

This means in order to survive an organization needs to keep the wheels running while we keep searching for the next thing, if we can't do both or can't balance them the organization will vanish, I think Bimodal is a "cheap" shoot at reframing Ambidexterity in an IT context, but this does nok make the idea of a duality in the organization a bad idea. 

O'Reilly and Tushman introduces the idea of Structural Ambidexterity, 
> Ambidexterity, in this conceptualization, entails not only separate structural subunits for Exploration and Exploitation but also different competencies, systems, incentives, processes and cultures—each internally aligned. [^O'Reilly & Tushman, 2007, p. 22]



#Critique of Structural Ambidexterity (Bimodal)#
##Is change an enemy of reliability/stability?##

##Strategy or Tactical##
Development is seen as strategy and Operation is seen as tactical

##Sprinters over Marathoners, tales of bi-cultured##

##The real problem##
is innovation, not how we maintain or develop the IT.
