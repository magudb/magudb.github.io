# Who am I ?
![Magnus udbjorg]({{ site.author.thumb }})
I'm a developer by heart, but currently studying an executive masters in IT-Management. I think almost every aspect of IT is interesting and something that we can use to bring good to the world. always trying to share everything i find interesting, this is my way of trying to stay on top of the everchanging world of technologies. I'm working for Codehouse A/S, a consultancy based in Copenhagen. Most i work with LEGO on development of their content management platform.
