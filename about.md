# Who am I ?
I'm a developer by heart and a leader, an Executive Master in IT-Management, BA in Social science and Computer science. Almost every aspect of IT is exciting and something we can use to bring good to the world. Always try to share everything I find interesting; this is my way of staying on top of the ever-changing world of technology.
